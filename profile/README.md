- **.github/build.sh** - Universal build script symlinked into all plugins and theme
- **CLAUDE.md** - Architectural documentation files in root and individual projects

## Technology Stack

- **WordPress Multisite** - Core platform with native cross-site data access
- **PHP** - Procedural WordPress patterns with direct includes (`require_once`)
- **JavaScript** - Event-driven frontend interactions via CustomEvent system
- **Composer** - Development dependencies and external libraries (ai-http-client)
- **React Native** - Mobile app (planning stage only - no implementation)

## Architecture Overview

**Hardcoded Blog IDs**: All plugins and theme use hardcoded blog IDs for performance. Only extrachill-search plugin uses `get_sites()` for comprehensive network discovery during search operations.

**Newsletter Integration System**: Three-plugin architecture with centralized `extrachill_multisite_subscribe()` bridge function, zero hardcoded credentials, and filter-based integration registration.

**Universal Build System**: Shared `.github/build.sh` script symlinked into all 16 implemented plugins and theme for consistent production ZIP generation with automatic project type detection.

**Template Override System**: Theme uses `template_include` filter with plugin-extensible template routing allowing plugins to control specific site homepages (chat, events, stream).

## Getting Started

Each repository contains its own `CLAUDE.md` file with project-specific development guidance. See the organization's shared `CLAUDE.md` for cross-repository standards.
